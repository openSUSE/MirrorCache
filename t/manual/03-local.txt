Testing mirrorcache locally.

executable 03-local.sh will build and spawn Docker container with local MirrorCache instance, which serves files from folder mc1/dt in checkout path of MirrorCache project.

example use to start container (port 80 must be free on the host):

git clone https://github.com/openSUSE/MirrorCache ~/testmc
cd ~/testmc/t/manual
EXPOSE_PORT=3110 ./03-local.sh

example check hashes generation from outside of container:

cd ~/testmc
mkdir mc1/dt/folder1
echo 1111 > mc1/dt/folder1/aaa


curl -s 127.0.0.1:80/download/folder1 | grep aaa
curl -s 127.0.0.1:80/download/folder1/aaa

curl -si 127.0.0.1:80/download/folder1/aaa.meta4
sleep 20 # the service needs some time to generage metalink file
curl -si 127.0.0.1:80/download/folder1/aaa.meta4
