= Welcome to MirrorCache!

MirrorCache is a Web Server for files download, which will route download requests to an appropriate mirror.
MirrorCache doesn't store files and instead keeps in DB list of files from the `Main Server` .

Requests to unknown files will be redirected to the `Main Server` (in this case download.opensuse.org):

[source,bash]
-----------------
> curl -I http://mirrorcache.opensuse.org/download/update/openSUSE-current/x86_64/alsa-1.1.5-lp152.8.6_lp152.9.4.1.x86_64.drpm
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: http://download.opensuse.org/update/openSUSE-current/x86_64/alsa-1.1.5-lp152.8.6_lp152.9.4.1.x86_64.drpm

-----------------

Then background jobs will collect info about the hottest misses and scan predefined mirrors for presence of these files. Further requests will be redirected to one of the mirrors that has the file:

[source,bash]
-----------------
> curl -I http://mirrorcache.opensuse.org/download/update/openSUSE-current/x86_64/alsa-1.1.5-lp152.8.6_lp152.9.4.1.x86_64.drpm
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
location: http://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/opensuse/update/openSUSE-current/x86_64/alsa-1.1.5-lp152.8.6_lp152.9.4.1.x86_64.drpm
date: Wed, 29 Jul 2020 08:40:00 GMT
-----------------

The project is in early development state.
